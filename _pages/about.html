      	<center><h3> What is the Dancing with AI curriculum? </h3></center>
      	<p>Physical movement is one of the most engaging ways to interact with AI systems, but it’s rare today to see motion integrated with K-12 AI curricula. Beyond that, many middle schoolers have passionate interests in dance, art, physical movement in sports, and video games that involve physical motion (Beat Saber, Just Dance) which aren’t easy to build on in the typical creative learning environments found in classrooms. Dancing with AI is a week-long workshop curriculum in which students conceptualize, design, build, and reflect on interactive physical-movement-based multimedia experiences. Students will learn to build interactive AI projects using two new Scratch Extension tools developed for this curriculum: (1) hand/body/face position-tracking and expression-detecting blocks based on the machine learning models PoseNet & MediaPipe from Google and Affectiva’s face model, and (2) Teachable Machine blocks that allow students to train their own image- and pose-recognition models on Google’s Teachable Machine and use them as part of their projects.</p>
      	<p> The goal of this curriculum is to engage students with interactive lessons and projects, and to have them think critically about AI and natural interaction. Throughout this course, students will have open-ended discussions on questions such as:
      		<ul>
      			<li>- How do we compare and contrast forms of representation?</li>
      			<li>- How do we interact with other humans vs. how do we interact with AI?</li>
      			<li>- What are forms of bias that can arise from improperly trained machine learning models, and how can we remediate those biases?</li>
      			<li>- What kind of projects can you create with interactive AI that will benefit your community?</li>
      		</ul>
      	</p>
      	<p>These questions will allow students to reflect on their own abilities as consumers and creators of interactive AI, and have them think critically about the ways it can help and harm society.</p>
